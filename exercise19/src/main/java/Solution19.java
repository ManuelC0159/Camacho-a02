* PseudoCode
* Get weight in pounds from user

* Get height in inches from user
* If user input was not a double, ask again
* Find BMI by doing BMI = (weight/height^2)*703
* If BMI is less than 18.5 print user is underweight
* if BMI is more than 25 print user is overweight
* else print user is within ideal weight range
